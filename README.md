Stock Ranking Project

	This project builds a monthly stock-selection pipeline for S&P 100 equities, evaluates several machine learning models, and exposes the results through a Streamlit demo application.

	The core idea is:

		1.Collect S&P 100 daily market data.
		2.Convert it into monthly features.
		3.Build an ML dataset for a top-20% stock-selection task.
		4.Train and evaluate classification models.
		5.Convert model scores into monthly portfolio returns.
		6.Export metrics, stock recommendations, and plots.
		7.Present the walk-forward results in a Streamlit app.

	Project Goals
		·Predict which stocks are likely to be in the top 20% by next-month return.
		·Rank stocks each month by predicted probability.
		·Form a portfolio from the top-ranked names.
		·Evaluate both classification quality and portfolio performance.
		·Compare walk-forward portfolio performance with SPY when benchmark data is available.

	Main Workflow
	
		The pipeline is orchestrated by [main.py]

		1. Data Collection
			[data_loader.py]

				·fetch_sp100_tickers()
					Scrapes the S&P 100 member list from Wikipedia.
				·download_daily_data()
					Downloads daily OHLCV data with yfinance.
				·reshape_to_long_format()
					Converts Yahoo Finance output into a long table with one row per ticker-date pair.

		2. Monthly Aggregation
			[preprocess.py]

				·build_monthly_features_from_daily()
					Converts daily data into monthly return, monthly volatility, and average monthly volume.

		3. Market Cap Enrichment
			[market_cap.py]

				·build_monthly_market_cap_from_daily()
					Uses month-end price and sharesOutstanding from Yahoo Finance to estimate market cap.
				·add_market_cap_to_monthly()
					Merges the market cap data into the monthly table.
				·clean_and_prepare()
					Cleans invalid values and adds Log_Market_Cap.
		
		4. ML Feature Engineering
			[feature_engineering.py]

			build_ml_dataset() creates the modeling dataset. The engineered features include:

				·Momentum features:
					ret_1m, ret_3m, ret_6m, ret_12m
					momentum_accel
				·Volatility features:
					vol_1m, vol_3m, vol_6m
					downside_vol_3m
				·Volume and liquidity features:
					avg_volume_1m, avg_volume_3m
					volume_change_1m, volume_ratio_1m_3m
					log_volume_change_1m
				·Size features:
					market_cap_1m, market_cap_3m_avg
					market_cap_change_1m, market_cap_ratio_1m_3m
					log_market_cap_1m, log_market_cap_change_1m
				·Cross-sectional rank features:
					monthly percentile ranks of return, volatility, volume, and market-cap features
				·Interaction feature:
					momentum_volume_interaction = ret_3m_rank * vol_3m_rank
		
			The target variables are:

				·future_return_1m
				·label_top20
					equals 1 if the stock is in the top 20% of next-month returns within that month
		
	Modeling
		[model_module.py]

		This module defines the standard models and the common model utilities.

		Models
			·Logistic Regression
			·Random Forest
			·XGBoost
	
		Feature Sets
			·BASE_FEATURE_COLUMNS
				used for Logistic Regression
			·RANDOM_FOREST_FEATURE_COLUMNS
				extends the base set with additional nonlinear-friendly features
			·XGBOOST_FEATURE_COLUMNS
				currently matches the Random Forest feature set
		
		Standard Evaluation
			run_standard_models() runs:

				·Logistic Regression with train_test_split
				·Random Forest with a time split
				·XGBoost with a time split
				
			For each model, the pipeline computes:

				·accuracy
				·ROC AUC
				·classification report
				·average return of the top-20% ranked stocks
				·overall average return
				·portfolio metrics derived from the ranked stock picks
				
	Walk-Forward Evaluation
		[walk_forward_model.py]

		This is the main evaluation mode used by the demo application.

		Why Walk-Forward
			Walk-forward validation better reflects a real investment workflow:

				·train on past months
				·test on the next month
				·roll the window forward
				·repeat until the sample is exhausted

		Key Functions
			·prepare_walk_forward_data()
				filters rows with missing required features
			·build_walk_forward_slices()
				creates rolling train/test windows
			·choose_threshold_from_training_predictions()
				chooses a classification threshold
			·run_walk_forward_validation()
				trains the model fold by fold and collects predictions and metrics
				
		Threshold Strategy
			The default threshold strategy is target_rate, which tries to match the positive rate in training data rather than always using 0.5.

			Other supported strategies:

				·balanced_accuracy
				·f1
		
	Portfolio Construction and Metrics
		[metrics_module.py]

		This module converts ranked predictions into portfolio returns.

		Logic
			·Rank each stock within each month by model score.
			·Select stocks with pred_rank >= 0.8.
			·Average their realized next-month return.
			·Compound monthly returns into cumulative return.
			
		Reported Portfolio Metrics
			·portfolio_months
			·avg_monthly_return
			·monthly_return_std
			·monthly_win_rate
			·cumulative_return
			·annualized_sharpe
			·best_month_return
			·worst_month_return
			·avg_monthly_picks

	Benchmark Comparison
		[benchmark_module.py]

		This module builds a monthly SPY benchmark series and aligns it with each model portfolio.

		Functions
			·fetch_benchmark_monthly_returns()
				downloads monthly SPY returns
			·build_portfolio_benchmark_comparison()
				aligns portfolio returns and benchmark returns by month
			·summarize_portfolio_benchmark_comparison()
				creates summary statistics such as excess cumulative return
				
		The current export logic applies the portfolio-vs-SPY comparison to walk-forward portfolios only.

	Plotting
		[plot_module.py]

		This module generates:

			·cumulative portfolio return plots
			·portfolio vs SPY comparison plots
			·model comparison bar charts
			
	Demo Application
		The end-user UI is implemented with Streamlit.

		Data Layer
			[demo_data_module.py] This module:

				·loads exported artifact CSV files
				·filters them to walk_forward
				·provides helper functions for:
					available models
					available target months
					top-ranked stock recommendations
					portfolio history
					benchmark history
					metrics lookup
		Streamlit UI
			[streamlit_app.py]

			The app allows an end user to:

				·choose a model
				·choose a target month
				·view recommended top-rank stocks
				·inspect historical cumulative portfolio performance
				·inspect walk-forward evaluation metrics
				·inspect SPY benchmark comparison when available

	Generated Outputs
		The project writes outputs into artifacts/.

		Metrics
			Stored in artifacts/metrics/:

				·model_metrics_summary.csv
					combined standard and walk-forward model metrics
				·walk_forward_metrics_summary.csv
					walk-forward metrics only
				·selected_stock.csv
					monthly ranked stock recommendations
				·portfolio_time_series.csv
					monthly portfolio return path
				·portfolio_vs_spy.csv
					walk-forward portfolio vs SPY monthly comparison
				·portfolio_vs_spy_summary.csv
					aggregated portfolio vs SPY comparison
				·optimizer_input.csv
					main input file for the optimization part
				·optimizer_risk_options.csv
					candidate risk columns that can be used as r_i
			
		Plots
			Stored in artifacts/plots/:

				·cumulative_returns.png
				·portfolio_vs_spy.png
				·model_comparison.png
				
	Configuration
		[config.py]

		This file defines:

			·data directories
			·artifact directories
			·date range
			·default file paths
			
		It also contains a fallback so that if the processed ML dataset does not exist in data/processed/, the code can reuse the local legacy file:

			·sp100_monthly_ml_dataset.csv
			
	How To Run
		1. Run the pipeline
			From the src directory:

				python main.py
			To force a fresh rebuild:

				python main.py --rebuild-data
		2. Launch the demo app
			streamlit run streamlit_app.py
	
	Expected Dependencies
		Based on the imports used in the codebase, the project depends on:

			pandas
			numpy
			requests
			yfinance
			scikit-learn
			matplotlib
			seaborn
			streamlit
			xgboost optional
			
	Notes About Current Behavior
		·The demo is driven by exported artifact CSV files, not by live model training inside Streamlit.
		·Walk-forward results are the primary user-facing evaluation mode.
		·The cumulative return comparison plot is currently limited to walk-forward models.
		·If benchmark download fails, the pipeline skips SPY comparison and still completes.
		·If the local ML CSV is missing momentum_volume_interaction, main.py backfills it in memory.
